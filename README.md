# Weather Info
A weather app that uses OpenWeatherMap API.


This uses OpenWeatherMap's free plan to get the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days in 3-hour intervals.
I use this data to compile a Flask web app. The app is comprised of 3 main parts:
- Python (main.py): the Flask code and the weather and forecast logic
- HTML/CSS (index.html/style.css): used to create a user-friendly interface
- JavaScript (scripts.js): the JavaScript code for showing and hiding the loading spinner.

This project is deployed on the web at https://weather-info.ddns.net/.
The https://weather-info.ddns.net/ server is not always activated to save energy.
